# Angular Portfolio Website

This is a repository for my personal portfolio website built using the Angular framework. It showcases my skills, projects, and achievements in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. The website is designed to provide an overview of my work and experience to potential clients, employers, or anyone interested in learning more about me.

Please note that this website currently only includes the front-end portion. However, I may add an API in the future to enhance its functionality and provide dynamic data. With the addition of an API, I will be able to retrieve data from a database or external sources, such as fetching project information or blog posts, making the website even more interactive and engaging.

## Features

- **Home:** Introduces myself and provides a brief overview of my skills and expertise.
- **Projects:** Showcases my projects with descriptions, images, and links to live demos or repositories.
- **Resume:** Provides a downloadable version of my resume in PDF format.
- **Contact:** Allows visitors to get in touch with me through a contact form or by clicking on my social media links.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures the website is accessible and looks great on various devices and screen sizes.

Feel free to explore website and navigate through the different sections to learn more about my work and background. This website is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. You can click on the navigation menu items or scroll down to access different sections.

Please note that the current version of the website uses static data and does not require an API. However, in the future, when an API is added, the website will be able to retrieve and display dynamic data, enabling features like real-time project updates, blog integration, or fetching data from external sources.

If you wish to customize the content or design of the website, you can modify the Angular components, HTML templates, stylesheets, and assets in the repository. You can also replace the placeholder images with your own project screenshots or photos.
